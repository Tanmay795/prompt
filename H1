To get a user story closer to 60% passing the QUS criteria, we need to address the most significant violations while keeping it reasonably concise. Here's a revised user story and its analysis:
Revised User Story:
"As a Strata customer, I want to select a new category for my Self-Select Chip, so that I can customize my benefits. The system should allow me to choose from a list of categories and confirm my selection, updating the Self-Select Chip with my new choice. If I choose not to change the category, I should be able to return to the Self-Select Chip without saving."
Analysis:
 * Well-formed: Passed - It now follows the "As a...I want...so that..." structure.
 * Atomic: Partially Violated - It still contains two scenarios (changing and not changing the category), but they are closely related.
 * Minimal: Partially Violated - It still contains some system behaviour, but it is less than the original.
 * Conceptually sound: Passed - The means and ends are logically connected.
 * Problem-oriented: Partially passed - It focuses more on the user's goal (customizing benefits) than the UI elements.
 * Unambiguous: Partially Passed - Some Strata specific terms are used.
 * Conflict-free: Passed - No internal conflicts.
 * Full sentence: Passed - Grammatically correct.
 * Estimatable: Partially Violated - The two scenarios still make it slightly more difficult to estimate.
 * Unique: Passed - No duplicates in this context.
 * Uniform: Passed - Follows the standard template.
 * Independent: Partially Violated - It still depends on the system providing a list of categories.
 * Complete: N/A - Only one story.

    "Estimatable: Two scenarios make it slightly harder to estimate.",
    "Independent: Depends on the system providing a list of categories."
  ]
}

Explanation of Improvements:
 * The "If...Then" structure has been replaced with the standard "As a...I want...so that..." format.
 * The story focuses more on the user's goal (customizing benefits) and less on specific UI elements.
 * The API specifications have been removed.
This revised story is closer to the 60% passing mark, as it addresses the most critical violations while keeping the story functional.
