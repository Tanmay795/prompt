**Prompt:**

**Given a user story, analyze it based on the following criteria and generate a JSON output with the structure provided:**

**Criteria:**

* **Well-formed:**
    * **HasRole:** Does the story start with "As a [Role]"? (True/False)
    * **HasMeans:** Does the story contain a verb describing the desired action? (True/False)

* **Atomic:**
    * **SingleFeature:** Does the story focus on a single, clearly defined feature? (True/False)
    * **NoAndOr:** Does the story avoid using "and" or "or" to combine multiple features? (True/False)

* **Minimal:**
    * **NoImplementation:** Does the story avoid mentioning implementation details? (True/False)
    * **NoTestingHints:** Does the story avoid including testing instructions? (True/False)

* **Conceptually Sound:**
    * **MeansDefined:** Is the means clearly described? (True/False)
    * **EndJustified:** Does the end provide a valid and meaningful reason? (True/False)
    * **NoDependency:** Does the end avoid solely describing a dependency on another feature? (True/False)

* **Problem-oriented:**
    * **FocusesOnProblem:** Does the story describe the user's need or problem, not the solution? (True/False)

* **Unambiguous:**
    * **ClearTerms:** Are the terms and phrases used clear and unambiguous? (True/False)
    * **NoVagueTerms:** Does the story avoid vague terms like "quickly," "easily," or "efficiently"? (True/False)

* **Full Sentence:**
    * **CompleteSentence:** Is the story a grammatically correct and complete sentence? (True/False)

* **Estimatable:**
    * **ScopeDefined:** Does the story have a well-defined scope and is not overly broad? (True/False)

* **Unique:** 
    * **IsUnique:** (True/False) - Placeholder, requires comparison with other stories in the set to determine uniqueness.

* **Uniform:** 
    * **ConformsToTemplate:** (True/False) - Placeholder, requires a defined template for comparison.

* **Independent:** 
    * **NoDependencies:** (True/False) - Placeholder, requires analysis of dependencies on other stories.

* **Complete:** 
    * **ContributesToCompleteness:** (True/False) - Placeholder, requires analysis of the entire set of user stories to determine completeness.

* **Conflict-free:** 
    * **NoConflicts:** (True/False) - Placeholder, requires comparison with other stories to identify potential conflicts.

**Example User Story:**

"As a user, I want to be able to sort the search results by date so that I can easily find the most recent results."

**Expected Output:**

The JSON output should follow the provided structure, including:

* **"user_story"**: The original user story.
* **"corrected_user_story"**: A potential improved version of the user story (e.g., "As a user, I want to sort search results by date to find the most recent results first.").
* **"analysis"**: An object containing the results of the analysis for each criterion, with True/False values for each sub-criterion.

This prompt now includes the "corrected_user_story" field, allowing for the inclusion of potential improvements to the original user story within the JSON output.
